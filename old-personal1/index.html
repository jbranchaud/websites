        <p>I tell machines what to do everyday...</p>
        <p>I love writing code...</p>
        <p>I am a programmer!</p>
        <p>Currently, I am a graduate research assistant and master's student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln studying computer science. I am excited for the research I will be doing over the next two years, but I also look forward to getting out into industry. There is a lot of exciting stuff happening in the field right now. In addition to constantly being glued to my computer, I am a runner and I recently competed in the Omaha Half Marathon. I am still trying to decide what race I will work towards next. I am also engaged and will be marrying my fiance, Erin, on Sept. 8, 2012 (which seems to be approaching more quickly each day). Lastly, I am a huge Nebraska football fan. This is the Huskers' first year in the Big 10 and I am excited to see how things turn out. Go Big Red!</p>

                            This summer I am working for the National Institute of Aerospace (NIA) at NASA Langley in Virginia. I am working with the Formal Methods group (Suzette Person and Neha Rungta in particular) on a tool called DiSE. DiSE is a state-of-the-art technique that reduces the expenses of symbolic execution. This summer we are working on an extension that will enable us to get reductions in the analysis of heap-allocated memory.

                            I have been into photographry for a number of years now, but with only ever having a point-and-shoot camera, I have never taken it too seriously. I had been wanting to upgrade to a more legitimate camera for sometime. I finally decided to step it up to a Nikon D3100. I was able to get a good deal on the body and two lenses (Nikkor 18-55mm f/3.5-4.5 and Nikkor 55-300mm f/3.5-4.5) through Nikon and got them at <a href="http://www.rockbrookcamera.com/">Rockbrook Camera</a> in Lincoln.

                            Back in September the PIs and students (which includes myself) of a new Computer Science research grant got together in Pittsburgh for an initial meetup. Since then we have all been working away at our research while staying in touch with conference calls every two weeks. We just had a second meetup, but this time it was in Irvine, CA. Each student got to present on what they have been working on and it was interesting to see everyone's progress over the past 6 months. Our next meetup will be at UNL in Lincoln, NE (that's us!).

                            Earlier this month I got to attend my first conference, the International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE), in Lawrence, KS. I wasn't presenting a paper or poster, just attending for the experience. It was exciting getting to meet a bunch of people in my research area. It was also nice getting to finally meet a person face-to-face for the first time that I had been working with for months.

I wasn't as well trained leading into the race as I had hoped, but all in all I did pretty well. I placed 40th overall with a time of 90:35 which comes out to 6:55 mile splits. My goal was to break 90 minutes, so I came up a little short, but there is always the Lincoln Half in May. <a href="http://mtecresults.com/runner/show?rid=1221&race=530">Detailed Results</a></p>

                        <p>It was a short trip, but the 2 and 1/2 days I just spent in Pittsburgh, PA this past weekend were great. The reason for this trip was to have a meeting between those involved in getting a recent research grant. The grant is between about 6 researchers spread out between <a href="http://cse.unl.edu">UNL</a>, <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/">UCI</a> and <a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/">CMU</a>. We got to meet all the PIs and their students and have a number of brainstorming sessions about large scale, distributed software development and the theory and tools that can aid it. We will call ourselves SCALE (Social Coordination Across Large Environments) and we can be found online at <a href="http://www.SCALEresearchgroup.org">SCALEResearchGroup.org</a>.</p>

						<p>I am out of town (more specifically, the country) for the next two weeks for an excursion through Iceland and France. We just got to Reykjavik, Iceland today and in about 4 days we will be headed to a place called Taize in France where we will stay for a week. Adventures will be had!</p>

                        <p>I have had Google+ for about a week now and I found some features that I like, so I thought I would write a quick post to point them out. Check out the article and let me know what features you think Google has done a good job with. <a href="http://joshbranchaud.wordpress.com/2011/07/13/google-definitely-got-some-features-right/">Read more...</a></p>

There are a few holes here and there and I haven't plugged in all the content, but for the most part it is good to go. You might also notice the fancy links I put at the top right for <a href="http://www.twitter.com/jbrancha">twitter</a>, <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/pub/josh-branchaud/30/b42/928">LinkedIn</a>, and <a href="http://github.com/jbranchaud">GitHub</a>.</p>

                        <p>Well, you're looking at it. It took me an entire Sunday and a little bit of Monday evening to get this sucker up and running, but I am pretty pleased with the outcome. I have needed some sort of online portfolio for a while now and I think this website fits that role pretty well. I will do my best to keep everything up to date, time permitting of course. Thanks for checking it out.</p>
